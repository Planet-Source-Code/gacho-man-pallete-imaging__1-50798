### Description

This program transforms the colors of a picture you paste on it according to a 256 color pallete file (.PAL) you assign, it's very helpful on Pallete using games and you can save it as an 8 bit bitmap, SEE SNAPSHOT
 
### More Info
 
You must paste any image where the programs says

You must assign a 256 color .PAL file

The image the user pastes with the nearest colors the pallete can give

It's a little slow

The "not recommended" filters are not so reliable, as the Proximity Filter
